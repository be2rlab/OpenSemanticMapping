## News :triangular_flag_on_post:

- [2023/10/27] Add the code for LSeg per-pixel feature extraction and multi-view fusion. Check [this repo](https://github.com/pengsongyou/lseg_feature_extraction).
- [2023/03/31] Code is released.

## Interactive Demo
### No GPU is needed! Follow **[this instruction](./demo)** to set up and play with the real-time demo yourself.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./media/demo.gif" width="75%" />
</p>


Here we present a **real-time**, **interactive**, **open-vocabulary** scene understanding tool. A user can type in an arbitrary query phrase like **`snoopy`** (rare object), **`somewhere soft`** (property), **`made of metal`** (material), **`where can I cook?`** (activity), **`festive`** (abstract concept) etc, and the correponding regions are highlighted.


## Installation
Follow the [installation.md](installation.md) to install all required packages so you can do the evaluation & distillation afterwards.

## Data Preparation

We provide the **pre-processed 3D&2D data** and **multi-view fused features** for the following datasets:
- ScanNet
- Matterport3D
- nuScenes
- Replica
### Pre-processed 3D&2D Data
You can preprocess the dataset yourself, see the [data pre-processing instruction](scripts/preprocess/README.md).


Alternatively, we have provided the preprocessed datasets. One can download the pre-processed datasets by running the script below, and following the command line instruction to download the corresponding datasets:
```bash
bash scripts/download_dataset.sh
```
The script will download and unpack data into the folder `data/`. One can also download the dataset somewhere else, but link to the corresponding folder with the symbolic link:
```bash
ln -s /PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/FOLDER data
```
<details>
  <summary><strong>List of provided processed data</strong> (click to expand):</summary>
  
  - ScanNet 3D (point clouds with GT semantic labels)
  - ScanNet 2D (RGB-D images with camera poses)
  - Matterport 3D (point clouds with GT semantic labels)
  - Matterport 2D (RGB-D images with camera poses)
  - nuScenes 3D (lidar point clouds with GT semantic labels)
  - nuScenes 2D (RGB images with camera poses)
  - Replica 3D (point clouds)
  - Replica 2D (RGB-D images)
  - Matterport 3D with top 40 NYU classes
  - Matterport 3D with top 80 NYU classes
  - Matterport 3D with top 160 NYU classes
</details>

**Note**: 2D processed datasets (e.g. `scannet_2d`) are only needed if you want to do multi-view feature fusion on your own. If so, please follow the [instruction for multi-view fusion](./scripts/feature_fusion/README.md).

### Multi-view Fused Features
To evaluate our OpenScene model or distill a 3D model, one needs to have the multi-view fused image feature for each 3D point (see method in Sec. 3.1 in the paper).

You can run the following to directly download provided fused features:

```bash
bash scripts/download_fused_features.sh
```
<details>
  <summary><strong>List of provided fused features</strong> (click to expand):</summary>
  
  - ScanNet - Multi-view fused OpenSeg features, train/val (234.8G)
  - ScanNet - Multi-view fused LSeg features, train/val (175.8G)
  - Matterport - Multi-view fused OpenSeg features, train/val (198.3G)
  - Matterport - Multi-view fused OpenSeg features, test set (66.7G)
  - Replica - Multi-view fused OpenSeg features (9.0G)
  - Matterport - Multi-view fused LSeg features (coming)
  - nuScenes - Multi-view fused OpenSeg features (coming)
  - nuScenes - Multi-view fused LSeg features (coming)
</details>


Alternatively, you can also generate multi-view features yourself following the [instruction](./scripts/feature_fusion/README.md).


## Run
When you have installed the environment and obtained the **processed 3D data** and **multi-view fused features**, you are ready to run our OpenScene disilled/ensemble model for 3D semantic segmentation, or distill your own model from scratch.

### Evaluation for 3D Semantic Segmentation with a Pre-defined Labelsets
<p align="center">
  <img src="./media/benchmark_screenshot.jpg" width="80%" />
</p>

Here you can evaluate OpenScene features on different dataset (ScanNet/Matterport3D/nuScenes/Replica) that have pre-defined labelsets.
We already include the following labelsets in [label_constants.py](dataset/label_constants.py):
- ScanNet 20 classes (`wall`, `door`, `chair`, ...)
- Matterport3D 21 classes (ScanNet 20 classes + `floor`)
- Matterport top 40, 80, 160 NYU classes (more rare object classes)
- nuScenes 16 classes (`road`, `bicycle`, `sidewalk`, ...)

The general command to run evaluation:
```bash
sh run/eval.sh EXP_DIR CONFIG.yaml feature_type
```
where you specify your experiment directory `EXP_DIR`, and replace `CONFIG.yaml` with the correct config file under [`config/`](./config/). **`feature_type`** corresponds to per-point OpenScene features:
- `fusion`: The 2D multi-view fused features
- `distill`: features from 3D distilled model 
- `ensemble`: Our 2D-3D ensemble features

To evaluate with `distill` and `ensemble`, the easiest way is to use a pre-trained 3D distilled model. You can do this by using one of the config files with postfix `_pretrained`. 

For example, to evaluate the semantic segmentation on Replica, you can simply run:
```bash
# 2D-3D ensemble
sh run/eval.sh out/replica_openseg config/replica/ours_openseg_pretrained.yaml ensemble

# Run 3D distilled model
sh run/eval.sh out/replica_openseg config/replica/ours_openseg_pretrained.yaml distill

# Evaluate with 2D fused features
sh run/eval.sh out/replica_openseg config/replica/ours_openseg_pretrained.yaml fusion
```
The script will automatically download the pretrained 3D model and run the evaluation for Matterport 21 classes.
You can find all outputs in the `out/replica_openseg`.

For evaluation options, see under `TEST` inside `config/replica/ours_openseg_pretrained.yaml`. Below are important evaluation options that you might want to modify:
- `labelset` (default: None, `scannet`| `matterport` | `matterport40`| `matterport80`|`matterport160`): Evaluate on a specific pre-defined labelset in [label_constants.py](./dataset/label_constants.py). If not specified, same as your 3D point cloud folder name
- `eval_iou` (default: True): whether evaluating the mIoU. Set to `False` if there is no GT labels
- `save_feature_as_numpy` (default: False): save the per-point features as `.npy`
- `prompt_eng` (default: True): input class name X -> "a X in a scene"
- `vis_gt` (default: True):  visualize point clouds with GT semantic labels
- `vis_pred` (default: True): visualize point clouds with our predicted semantic labels
- `vis_input` (default: True): visualize input point clouds

If you want to use a 3D model distilled from scratch, specify the `model_path` to the correponding checkpoints `EXP/model/model_best.pth.tar`.


### Distillation
Finally, if you want to distill a new 3D model from scratch, run:

- Start distilling:
```sh run/distill.sh EXP_NAME CONFIG.yaml```

- Resume: 
```sh run/resume_distill.sh EXP_NAME CONFIG.yaml```

For available distillation options, please take a look at `DISTILL` inside `config/matterport/ours_openseg.yaml`


### Using Your Own Datasets
1. Follow the [data preprocessing instruction](./scripts/preprocess/README.md), modify codes accordingly to obtain the processed 2D&3D data
2. Follow the [feature fusion instruction](./scripts/feature_fusion/README.md), modify codes to obtain multi-view fused features.
3. You can distill a model on your own, or take our provided 3D distilled model weights (e.g. our 3D model for ScanNet or Matterport3D), and modify the `model_path` accordingly.
4. If you want to evaluate on a specific labelset, change the `labelset` in config.


## Applications
Besides the zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation, we can perform also the following tasks:
- **Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding and exploration**: query a 3D scene to understand properties that extend beyond fixed category labels, e.g. materials, activity, affordances, room type, abstract concepts...
- **Rare object search**: query a 3D scene database to find rare examples based on their names
- **Image-based 3D object detection**: query a 3D scene database to retrieve examples based on similarities to a given input image
